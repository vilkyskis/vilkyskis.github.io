My first post on Jekyll. 

## Site's main purpose ##

This site is my own portfolio, where i upload my projects, and show my own site.

## Site development ##

This site is developed with `jekyll` with the main purpose of it being static, without the use of php or JS. Visit [Jekyll's main page][jekyll-mp] for more information.

I desided to stick to `minima` theme for the learning purposes
so the idea is to edit out this theme to fit my needs. Visit [minima's github page][minima-gh] for more information. 

My plans is as follows:
*   Add profile route
*   Learn jekyll
